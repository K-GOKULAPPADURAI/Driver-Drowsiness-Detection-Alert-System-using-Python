# Driver Drowsiness Detection Alert System Using Python

A tool designed to detect driver drowsiness through face recognition and alert the driver with voice commands. This project leverages Python and machine learning concepts to ensure driver safety by monitoring yawning and eye focus.

## Overview

This project uses several powerful libraries and frameworks:
- **dlib**: A machine learning library for face recognition and landmark prediction.
- **imutils**: A collection of convenience functions to work with images and video frames.
- **scipy**: Used to calculate yawning and eye focus percentages.
- **OpenCV**: A comprehensive library for image and video processing.
- **argparse**: Provides a command-line interface for running the project with specific parameters.

### Hardware Requirements

- A camera with at least 2.0 MP resolution.
- An audio speaker for alerts.
- A Raspberry Pi or a computer system to connect and process the frames using Python.

### Project Functionality

The camera captures 10 frames per second. Each frame is checked against the defined thresholds for yawning and eye focus. Alerts are triggered via the speaker:
- **Eye Alert**: "Open your eyes, sir."
- **Yawn Alert**: "Take some fresh air, sir."

Press `q` to quit the application.

### Challenges

The most challenging part was installing the `dlib` library, as many Python versions do not support it directly. After extensive research, the compatible versions were identified as Python 3.8.5 and `dlib` 19.19.0. Although an XML file can be used for face detection, it is less accurate than `dlib`.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8.5**: Ensure that Python 3.8.5 is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/).

- **Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools**: Required for compiling some of the libraries.
    1. Download the [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
    2. During installation, ensure you select the **C++ build tools** and the **Windows 10 SDK**.
    3. Refer this for a complete tutorial for installation https://youtu.be/_keTL9ymGjw?si=7OAD3mpyqf1sf-FP
  
### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/K-GOKULAPPADURAI/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Alert-System-using-Python-.git
   cd Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Alert-System-using-Python-
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - **Install CMake**:
     ```bash
     pip install cmake
     ```
   - **Install Other Dependencies**:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your Python version is 3.8.5 to avoid compatibility issues, especially with `dlib`.
- If `dlib` installation fails, verify that you have correctly installed the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools with the necessary components.
- You can modify thresholds and other settings directly within the `main.py` file as needed.
